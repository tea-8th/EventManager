# EventManager



Changes in settings.py file in eventmanager folder:
1. Security key will be your own project's security key.
2. Database name, username, password, host, portnumber etc. will be as per your configuration
(I have put a comment where you have to make changes)

This is a medicore website created by me with my team during a project when pursuing MSc.IT, you can improve its front-end and back-end as per your requirement.

Also the upload images will be stored in images->pics-> So that folder is empty right now.
